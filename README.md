![NiriMod Interface](media/1.png)

Niri's config is a KDL file, and editing it by hand works fine — until it doesn't. Tweaking animation curves blind, guessing monitor names, or accidentally overlapping keybinds gets old fast. NiriMod gives you a proper GUI for the stuff that's annoying to do in a text editor, while staying out of the way for everything else.

---

## What it looks like

### Outputs & Animations

The left side handles display config — scaling, resolution, the usual. The right side is an animation editor where you can actually see the easing curve instead of guessing cubic-bezier values and reloading twenty times.

*(That's the screenshot above.)*

---

### Keybinds

![Keybinding Management](media/2.png)

Two views: a physical keyboard map that shows you which keys are bound (so you stop clobbering your own shortcuts), and a searchable list for when you just want to find and change something quickly.

---

### Multi-file configs

![Multi-File Configurations](media/multiple_configs.png)

If you split your niri config across multiple files with `include` directives, NiriMod handles that. It parses all the included files together and writes changes back to the correct file. You don't need to flatten your config to use this.

## Demo

> *If the video doesn't load, grab [`demo.mp4`](media/demo.mp4) directly.*

---

## How it stays safe

NiriMod won't write a broken config to disk. Every save runs through `niri validate` first — if it doesn't pass, nothing gets written.

Beyond that:

- **Undo/Redo** — `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, unlimited history
- **Config preservation** — NiriMod only touches settings it manages. Your startup commands, scripts, and anything it doesn't understand are left alone.
- **Profiles** — save named config snapshots ("deep work", "gaming", etc.) and switch between them
- **Raw mode** — built-in KDL editor with syntax highlighting for when you want to go manual

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinivasr/nirimod/main/install.sh | bash
```

This runs an interactive installer that handles dependencies for you.

| Flag | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--install` | Skip the prompts, install directly |
| `--uninstall` | Remove NiriMod cleanly |
| `--skip-deps` | Skip system package manager checks (for Gentoo, Nix, etc.) |

---

## Requirements

Works on Arch, Fedora, openSUSE, and Debian/Ubuntu out of the box. For other distros like Gentoo, use the `--skip-deps` flag and install the following packages manually:

**Gentoo** (requires the [GURU overlay](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU) for `niri`):
```bash
emerge dev-vcs/git net-misc/curl dev-lang/python gui-libs/gtk gui-libs/libadwaita dev-python/pygobject dev-python/pycairo x11-libs/libxkbcommon x11-misc/xkeyboard-config
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinivasr/nirimod/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --install --skip-deps
```

| Dependency | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Python 3.12+ | Runtime |
| GTK4 + libadwaita | UI toolkit |
| PyGObject & Pycairo | Python ↔ GTK bindings |
| [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | Env manager — the installer handles this |
| niri | The compositor you're configuring |
